#Notes for al-Faṣeeḥ Arabic Course

Please note that this page is being frequently updated, so please check back regularly. 

We have now moved to a **new system** for the class, whereby we are using [Quizlet](http://www.quizlet.com) to host all vocabulary. You can visit the [al-Faseeh Class](http://quizlet.com/class/1481660/) on Quizlet, and sign up as a class member. Your progress will be shared with the course instructor.

You can now also access the [master list of vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pceAP75lUh6RDRrhWZbbsb1N39cXu25QgDU2cfYMIiw/edit?usp=sharing), as a Google Sheets file. This allows you to see the vocabulary in table format, with plurals, the origin of the words, feminine equivalents, and so on. As a student, you can't edit this file.

Word documents are now being phased out. For now, the lesson summary will only be attached as a PDF from the powerpoint presentation. It is expected - in shā' Allāh - that this will also be phased out, and replaced with a better suited tool in future lessons.
